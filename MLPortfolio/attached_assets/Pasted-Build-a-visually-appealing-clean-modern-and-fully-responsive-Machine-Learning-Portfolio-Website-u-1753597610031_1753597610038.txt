Build a visually appealing, clean, modern, and fully responsive Machine Learning Portfolio Website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and **animation frameworks like AOS (Animate on Scroll), GSAP, or Lottie** for interactive ML-themed effects.

🧾 Folder Structure:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- /images/
- /animations/ (optional JSON for Lottie)

---

🎯 Website Purpose:
Showcase ML projects categorized by algorithm type (Supervised and Unsupervised), each with animated project cards and interactive features.

---

🔹 Sticky Navbar:
- Navigation links: Home, About, Algorithms
- Logo or initials on the left
- Highlight current section on scroll
- Smooth scrolling with animation

---

🏠 Hero Section:
- Full name and tagline: **“ML Projects by Algorithm”**
- Animated typewriter text rotating between:
  “Supervised Learning”, “Unsupervised Learning”, “End-to-End ML Pipelines”, “Model Deployment”
- Buttons:
  - View Projects
  - Download Resume
- Optional: Lottie animation of ML model, data flowing, or neural networks

---

👤 About Section:
- Short 2–3 paragraph introduction explaining:
  - Your passion for ML
  - Technologies used (e.g., Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Streamlit)
  - What the portfolio covers
- Optional: Add AOS or GSAP scroll reveal animation for text and visuals

---

🧠 **Algorithms Section** (Core):
Split into two animated subsections using tabs or accordion:

### 🔷 Supervised Learning
Include these project cards:
1. **Linear Regression** – House Price Prediction
2. **Logistic Regression** – Breast Cancer Prediction
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Handwritten Digit Recognition
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – Email Spam Classifier
5. **Decision Tree** – Loan Approval Prediction
6. **XGBoost / LightGBM** – Credit Card Fraud Detection

### 🔶 Unsupervised Learning
Include these project cards:
7. **K-Means Clustering** – Customer Segmentation  
8. **Hierarchical Clustering** – Document Similarity Clustering

---

📦 Each Project Card Includes:
- Algorithm Name
- Project Title
- Dataset used
- Short description
- Tech stack (badges/icons)
- GitHub & Live Demo buttons
- 🔁 Animations:
  - Hover zoom
  - Card fade-in/slide-up on scroll (using AOS/GSAP)
  - Optional: Lottie icon (e.g., clustering, regression line)

---

✨ Additional Features:
- Font Awesome icons
- Use AOS, GSAP, or Lottie for micro-interactions
- Responsive layout (media queries for mobile/tablet)
- Dark mode toggle (optional)
- Smooth scroll between sections
- Placeholder text, links, and images
- Use only HTML, CSS, JavaScript (+ allowed animation libraries)
